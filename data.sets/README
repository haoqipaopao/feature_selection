``Gene selection and classification of microarray data using random forest''
by R. Díaz-Uriarte and S. Alvarez de Andrés.

)




*.data.txt: the gene expression data, in genes * subjects arrays.
*.class.txt: the class indicator.


Files are tab separated. The first row of each gene expression data set
starts with a "#", so watch out what your software does with it.

Everything else should be self-explanatory EXCEPT for:
xdata2.txt and Class: this is just a small data set to play with.
